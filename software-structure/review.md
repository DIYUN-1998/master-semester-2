# Part 1, Basic Architectural concepts

## 3 key concepts of architecture, and their definitions: Components, connectors, configurations

## UML2 notation for components, connectors, interfaces

## 4 properties of components: modularity, cohesion, encapsulation, reusability

## Provided and required interfaces

## Laws of substitutability of one component for another

## Assembly connectors


Part 2, simple process for defining architectures

Structure of 3-tier architectures

Business concept models (you will need to be able to draw & read these), use case models (read only)

Defining system and business interfaces in the business layer

Deriving system interfaces from use cases

[Not collaboration diagrams, or business interface derivation]


Part 3, Compound connectors, simple styles

Compound component definition and notation

Delegation connectors

Pipes and filters style: characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, examples


Session 4: more styles, complex connectors

Synchronous & asynchronous communication, publish/subscribe connectors

2-tiered (client/server) style

3-tiered and N-tiered

Layered architecture

Blackboard style

MVC style

Combining styles


Sessions 5, 6: .NET enterprise services

Concepts of enterprise system and enterprise application servers; 
quality of service properties

Concepts of managed components

.NET enterprise services for COM+ components

Typical form of COM+ component in C# (but not detailed programming of these)

UML2 notation for COM+ architectures

Concepts of transactions, JIT, publish/subscribe, object pooling, in .NET. [Not queued components]

Specification of .NET styles as architectures, including ASP components, but not ASP coding or Web services in .NET


Session 7: Enterprise styles

View helper, Front controller, Session facade, Value object: structure, benefits and examples


Session 8: Java EE

Java EE concepts and components: servlets, JSPs, EJBs. Definitions, not detailed coding.

Designing and drawing 5-tier architectures for EIS. 



Session 9: Mobile applications

Specific issues for mobile application design

Specific aspects of Android platform; MBaaS

Mobile application architecture patterns: MVC, VIPER, Online/offline DAO

Designing and drawing architectures for mobile apps. 



Session 10: Services

Concepts of software-as-a-service, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS. 

SOAP and REST services. 

Concepts of SOA and microservices. Issues and patterns for service architectures. 

Designing and drawing architectures for SOA and microservices.
